## Where This Fits in With Everything Else

* check out the [schedule](../../schedule.html)
* we're doing about 3 weeks of JavaScript
* last class, we covered a bunch of super basic stuff (a bit of a drag, I know)

## Concerned About Not Knowing HTML/CSS?

Here are some resources.

* [Learn to Code HTML & CSS by Shay Howe](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) by Shay Howe
* [HTML Dog](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/)
* [Codecademy: Make a Website](http://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-a-website) by Codecademy

<br>
All are __free__ and __online__ ... and relatively compact!

You'll have some time to learn this, as we won't need any front-end development _at all_ for about a month.

## First Homework 

Homework #1 will be posted Friday evening. It'll help you get familiar with JavaScript syntax.

* __create a github account if you don't already have one__
* __send me your github username and your NYU NetID__ using [this form](https://docs.google.com/a/nyu.edu/forms/d/1mgHQ2NupHDAlirAcbYjeSShFeAWNyPH1sqCqa7zTe2M/viewform)
    * actually... let's just do it now!
    * if you don't have a laptop, do it from your phone or do it immediately when you get home
* (all of your assignments will be private)
* the assignment will likely be...
    * a few exercises from {{ site.vars.book_js }}
    * threes dice game... or maybe blackjack (yeah, you've probably done this before)
    * using some sort of input library
