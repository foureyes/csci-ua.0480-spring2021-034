## Last Few Classes...

So ... we're on the home stretch. __There are 4 classes left__!

Here's the plan. I'll try to get in these topics before the end of the semester, roughly in this order:

* {:.fragment} finishing up AJAX and Express, a peek at jQuery
* {:.fragment} A little bit more jQuery, a quick glimpse at Angular
* {:.fragment} Finishing up angular, deploying on Heroku, maybe some deploy tools
* {:.fragment} a review
</section>
