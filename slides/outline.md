## What is it?
### Why
### 
### Overview


### Next Steps

Before diving into the interesting features, let's check out:

* basic syntax
    * statements
    * ASI?
    * blocks w/ curly braces
* the type system / coercion - 
    * Values, Types, and Operators
    * Coercion (Revisited), Casting, Undefined, and Style
* Variables, Built-in Functions
* Control Structures
* functions
    * Functions
    * Hoisting
    * Functions Some More


### Syntax

### Type System


### Variables

### Control Structures


### Must Do

* always use const or let
* never use var
* compare with ===
* be careful when using operators like + - use "" if you plan on concatenating, coerce or make sure you have numbers if adding
* be consistent with semicolons (either use them on everything or don't)
* always declare loop variables (let / const work)
* don't use fall through (not js specific)
