# Final Project, __Final Milestone Due__ 11/30 at 11pm

Earlier milestones due every one or two weeks leading up to final milestone due date.


## Overview 

Create a __small__ web application using Express and MongoDB. Build the application incrementally over the course of 4-5 weeks.

<a name="requirements">

## Project Requirements

### Requirements

* You must use Express and MongoDB (or other server-side framework and database with permission)
* You must write your own code, with annotations/references added for any code sourced from books, online tutorials, etc.

### Grading Rubric

__Completing the milestones leading up to the due date is required!__ Milestones 1 through 3 are worth over half of your final project grade.

* (20) Milestone #1 - requirements, draft data model, and a skeleton application
* (20) Milestone #2 - deployment attempt and a single working form (__You cannot change _your idea_ for your final project after this__, but you can still make minor modifications)
* (20 points) Milestone #3 - two working forms and proof of work on research topics
* (40 points total) Completed project
    * (12 points) minimum 3 x forms or ajax interactions (__excluding login__)
    * (6 points) minimum 3 x any of the following (can be the same): 
        * es6 classes that you've written yourself (using the `class` keyword)
        * Object.create (where prototype matters)
        * original higher order functions that you've written yourself
		* or use any of these built-in higher order functions found in `Array.prototype`: `map`, `reduce`, `filter`
    * (2 points) minimum 2 x mongoose schemas
    * (8 points) stability / security
        * simple validation on user input to prevent application from crashing
        * doesn't allow user input to be displayed unescaped directly on page
        * pages that require authentication cannot be accessed without authentication
        * data specified as private to a user cannot be viewed by another user
        * etc.
    * (4 points) _originality_ 
        * is not mostly based on existing homework
        * majority of code is not from online tutorial
    * (8 points) worth of research topics; see below


{% comment %}
* provide api end points
* what data is authenticated
* urls of where data

### Due Date __11/9 at 11pm__ - Milestone 2 - Completed Schema, Initial Deployment, "Proof of Concept" First Form and Refinement or Start of Research Topics (20 points)

2. attempt to deploy your code to Courant's servers by following [instructions](homework/deploy.html)
3. <span class="warning">use [this form to submit your deployed site](https://forms.gle/SBBBQGFs13SGNiwT8)</span>
4. your submission won't be graded unless the form above is sent with urls to your deployed site
5. your deployed site should contain the following progress:
    * __one working form (that is not login or registration)__ 
        * ...that should allow data to be modified or deleted
        * the results of submitting this form should be apparent/viewable
		* __if planning on using AJAX with API backend__, proof of working API end point is adequate, as long as query string or POST datashows changes in data sent back by API
    * show _some_ progress, regardless of how small it is, on at least 1 of your research topics,  __it doesn't have to be fully working... stub code from documentation or pseudocode is adequate__
        * consequently, a link to the github repository / line no that shows any proof of work is sufficient
        * or, if it's something that's already visible, a link to the a page on your site that's deployed to the server
