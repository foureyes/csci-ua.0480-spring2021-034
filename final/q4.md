# Question 4 - DOM Manipulation

## Overview

Writing client side JavaScript in `public/04-clickable.js`, create an interactive web page that adds circles to a random location in the page once every 1.5 seconds (1500 ms). Clicking on a circle makes the circle disappear. 

The styles and some helper functions are already implemented and are available for your use. The markup is also already provided in `public/04-clickable.html`, __and should not be changed__.  You can view your work by going to [http://localhost:3000/04-clickable.html](http://localhost:3000/04-clickable.html)

## Requirements

1. generate a `div` element every 1.5 seconds
2. each element created should have a class, `clickable` (`.clickable`... already present in `04-clickable.html`, so no need to write); __this will style the `div` as a circle with a drop shadows__
3. each element should be placed in a random location 
	* a random integer generator function has been created and made available to you in the source of `04-clickable`.js
	* to retrieve the width and the height of the viewable area, use `innerWidth` and `innerHeight`
	* if setting width and height, don't forget to add unit (such as `em`, `rem`, `px`)
4. clicking on an element should make it visually disappear 

## Example Interaction

<img alt="clicking on circles" src="04-dom-timer.gif" style="width:95%">

## Testing

The html file, `public/04-clickable.html` (reachable by [http://localhost:3000/04-clickable.html](http://localhost:3000/04-lickable.html)), can be used to display your interactive website.

## Upload Your Solution
