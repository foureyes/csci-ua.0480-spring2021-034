# Question 3 - DOM Functions

## Overview

__Using the file `03-domFunctions.js`__, implement two functions: `createElement` and `mountElement`.

Going to  [http://localhost:3000/03-domFunctions.html](http://localhost:3000/03-domFunctions.html)) will exercise your function implementations by displaying text and an image of a wallaby. 

## Part 1 - `createElement`

`createElement` returns an `Element` (such as elements from the built-in `document.createElement`). However, it has two additional parameters that allows for:

* the ability to add attributes
* the ability to add children -- both text and other `Element` objects

... both within the original `createElement` call. For example:

```
const img = createElement('img', {src: 'wallaby.jpg', alt: 'a wallaby!'});
const div = createElement('div', {}, 'hello wallaby', img)
```
The resulting `div` would be:

```
<div>
	hello wallaby
	<img src='wallaby.jpg' alt='a wallaby!'>
</div>
```

### Parameters

* `elementName` (`String`) - the name of the element to create as a string, such as a `div` or a `p`
* `attributes` (`Object`) - an object that has keys representing attribute names and values representing attribute values: `{type: "text"}` would be resolve to `type="text"` within the returned `Element`
* an arbitrary number of `Element` objects (created from `createElement`) or strings - these elements and strings will be added as children to the returned `Element`

### Return 

* an `Element` 

### Hints

* internally, use `document.createElement` to create the `Element` to be returned
* to add text as a child of an element, you can create a text node by using `document.createTextNode(value)`... and then using `appendChild` as usual
* remember that `typeof` can be used to _sort of_ determine the type of an object... for example: `if(typeof child === 'string')` 
```

## Part 2 - `mountElement`

`mountElement` adds its first argument, an `Element`, to another `Element` specified by the second argument, the `selector`


Assuming a document that has the following markup:

```
<div id="foo"></div>
```

The following command will add an article element with text `hello` as a child of the above `div` with id `foo`:

```
mountElement(createElement('article', {}, 'hello'), '#foo');
```

The result should be:

```
<div id="foo">
	<article>hello</article>
</div>
```

### Parameters

* `element` (`Element`) - the element to add
* `selector` (`String`) - the CSS selector to use to find the element to add a child (the first argument) to 

### Return 

No return value,

## Additional Examples and Testing

The code at the end of `03-domFunctions.js` uses the following code to create several elements:

```
const h3 = createElement('h3', {}, 'hello');
const p = createElement('p', {className: 'foo'}, 'this is a wallaby');
const img = createElement('img', {src: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_necked_wallaby444.jpg', alt: 'wallaby'});
const article = createElement('article', {}, h3, p, 'a wallaby is not a computer', img)
```

The html file, `public/03-domFunctions.html` (reachable by [http://localhost:3000/03-domFunctions.html](http://localhost:3000/03-domFunctions.html)), can be used to display the results of the code above. Use it to test your implementation. The rendered page should include the text shown above (`hello this is a wallaby a wallaby is not a computer`), as well as an image of a wallaby.
