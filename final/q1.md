# Question 1 - Authentication

## Overview

__Using the file, `01-auth.js`__, finish the implementation of the function, `register`. The `register` function creates a new user (with username and password) in your web application. It takes an incoming set of credentials and -- using best practices for password storage -- saves them in MongoDB. 

⚠️ __Do not change the code before or after the function body for `register`.__

(if you have authentication enabled for you local mongodb installation, you can temporarily add username and password... and then strip them prior to uploading)

## Register Function 

1. Implement the body of the `register` function
2. `register` has 3 parameters:
	* `username` - the username entered by the user
		* you can assume that this will be normalized to all lowercase
	* `password` - the password entered by the user
	* `callback` - the function to call if the user is successfully "registered"
		* similar to other callback based async functions, this function will be invoked with two arguments...
		* `err` - `null` if no error, an object with an `error` key containing an error message, such as `{error: "some message"}`
3. If the username already exists 
	* call the callback with an error object with the following value for the error key: `user USERNAME exists`
	* for example: `{error: 'user foo exists'}`
	* the user object passed in to this callback as the second argument should be `null`
	* if using `find` to determine existence of a user, you can use `users !== undefined && users.length >= 0`
4. If the username doesn't exist, use the [`bcrypt.js` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) to help store credentials: 
	* (note: since about a year or two ago, a better choice than `bcrypt` might be `argon2`)
	* `bcryptjs` can be used to generate a salt __and__ hash a password
	* when using its `hash` function, __the salt and hash are concatenated into a singel value__ (consequently, only one field needs to be used to store both the salt and hash in the database)
	* the resulting value is in the following format: `$2b$[cost]$[22 character salt][31 character hash]`
	* first: `npm install bcryptjs`
	* example usage:
		```
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
bcrypt.genSalt(10, function(err, salt) {
    bcrypt.hash("somepassword", salt, function(err, hash) {
		// do something with resulting hash here
		// (the hash is passed in to this callback 
		// as the parameter named hash)
    });
});
```
5. If the `hash` function succeeds, save the new user to the database
6. If saving the user succeeds, call the callback using `null` as the error argument and the newly created user as the user object... for example:
	* error: `null`
	* user:  
		```
{
  _id: 5fd03a98d8f8770e4488546f,
  username: 'foo',
  password: '$2a$10$ofUSzXxMXR4T2/NJCfnyWuTdLJTQo9X5x5VaQgrgYxD1BxxKcj3nG',
  __v: 0
}
```
7. All errors can be (aside from a duplicate user) ignored, though the `err` object should be logged out to help debugging and grading

## Testing

Your file, `01-auth.js`, is a standalone program. You can run it with `node 01-auth.js`. The bottom of the file contains a call to `register`, so you can run your file to test your implementation: 

* the first run will log out the saved user 
* (you should also manually inspect your database with the `mongo` client)
* if you run the file twice, you should see a duplicate user error (if you've implemented)
* if you need to clear data from your database, you can use `db.users.remove({})`

## Upload Your Solution

Upload the file that your function is implemented in, `01-auth.js`.
