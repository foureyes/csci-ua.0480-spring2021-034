### Description

Create a card matching game with React.

{% comment %}
Create a game similar to  __MemorEmoji__ from  Homework 6, but using __React__ instead of plain JavaScript.

## Instructions

### Setup

Start by using `create-react-app` and developing locally. ‚ö†Ô∏è __Choose one person in your group to share their screen as you all code!__ Once you've done one or two parts, try deploying. 

To use `create-react-app` to develop locally:

* [see the instructions on setting up create-react-app in the slides](../slides/26/react-state-parent.html#/15)
* üëÄ the instructions and reference solution may refer to class-based components; if you're comfortable doing so, you can use functional components + `useState` and `useEffect` hooks


{% comment %}
    * [but also, __if you are having path issues, especially on windows__, see this github ticket](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/138#issuecomment-334316575)
{% endcomment %}

Then deploy using one of the options below:

1. remix a react starter boilerplate using [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/starter-react)
    * add your code to `app.jsx`
2. create a new project (pen) in [codepen.io](https://codepen.io)
    * debugging might be difficult
    * ...but your application will already be deployed!
    * to setup, configure babel as your JavaScript pre-processor and add React and ReactDOM Libraries:
        <br>

### Part 1 - Single Card

Create a React component or components so that you can toggle a card from being face down or face up. Note that rather than using css, you can manipulate the DOM directly in your jsx (for example, favor conditionally adding a text node to your JSX rather than setting visibility hidden). 

Lastly, to add a class to a React element, use `className=foo`, where `foo` is is your class name.

### Part 2 - Multiple Cards

Instead of just a single component that reacts to clicks, create several that can be clicked. Try to use parent and child components to do this. Clicking on any card toggles it from being face down to face up...or from face up to face down.

### Part 3 - Game

Now... only allow the player to flip two cards at a time. Once they flipped two cards, display a message and a confirmation button to proceed to the next turn. If the two cards flipped are the same, keep them face up. Otherwise, turn the cards back over so that the value is hidden.

### Part 4 - Game Over

When the game ends (all of the cards are face up and matched), replace the cards with a message that says: "Game Over"

### Deployment

To deploy your app on glitch.com... 

1. use the react starter boilerplate on [glitch.com](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/starter-react)
2. add your code to `app.jsx`
	* __Do not bring in `import` statements__
    * (it's already done at the top of `index.js` with `require`)
    * only add your components and your call to `ReactDOM.render`
3. add styles easily by adding a `style` tag in `index.html` and writing your css directly there

To deploy your app in codepen.io...

1. configure babel, React and React DOM as shown in the gif above (see Instructions &rarr; setup)
2. copy all of your __components__ over to the js panel (don't include any of the import statements)
3. you may have to change `extends` so that it's `extends React.Component` for each component
4. use ```ReactDom.render``` at the very end to render your main/root component:
    ```ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.body);```
