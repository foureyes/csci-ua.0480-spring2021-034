Abstractions
=====
method or structure that allows the programmer to hide away details that aren't relevant to the problem at hand

examples:
* function .... hide away the stuff in the body of the function, and we call the function by name
* class ... abstraction over data and actions you can perform on that data

javascript

* functions ... <--- today
	* higher order functions
	* a function that does one of the following
		1. have a function(s) as a paramter
		2. give back a function
		3. both!!!
